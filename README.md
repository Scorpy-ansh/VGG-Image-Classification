# VGG16 Image Classification Project

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project uses the **VGG16** deep learning model for image classification.  
We trained the model on a custom dataset to classify images into different categories.  
The model was implemented in **TensorFlow/Keras** and trained with transfer learning to get better accuracy with fewer epochs.
