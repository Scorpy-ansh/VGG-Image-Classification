# VGG16 Image Classification Project

## üìå Overview
This project uses the **VGG16** deep learning model for image classification.  
We trained the model on a custom dataset to classify images into different categories.  
The model was implemented in **TensorFlow/Keras** and trained with transfer learning to get better accuracy with fewer epochs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**  
   - Loaded dataset images.
   - Resized all images to **224x224** pixels.
   - Normalized pixel values between 0 and 1.

2. **Model Setup (VGG16)**  
   - Used pre-trained **VGG16** model from Keras with ImageNet weights.
   - Removed the top classification layer and added custom layers for our dataset.

3. **Training**  
   - Used **Adam optimizer**.
   - Applied callbacks like **EarlyStopping** and **ModelCheckpoint**.
   - Trained for **3 epochs**.

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Calculated accuracy and loss on the test set.
   - Generated classification report (Precision, Recall, F1-score).

5. **Visualization**  
   - Used **Grad-CAM** to see which parts of the image the model focuses on.
